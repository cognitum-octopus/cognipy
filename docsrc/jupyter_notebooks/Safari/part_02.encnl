Every-single-thing that is a plant and-or is a plant-part is a herb.
No herb is an animal.

Every carnivore eats nothing-but animals.
Every lion eats nothing-but herbivores.

Every herbivore eats nothing-but herb.

Anything either is a carnivore, is a herbivore or is an omnivore or-something-else.
Anything either is a branch, is a leaf or is a twig or-something-else.

No giraffe is a lion.
Every palm-tree is not a tree.
